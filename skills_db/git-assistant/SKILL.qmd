# Git Assistant

## Activation Words: commit, git, save, backup, push, version, source, repo, pull, merge, repository, checkout, branch, conflict

## Instructions
1. **Analyze Status**: Run `git status` to see what has changed.
2. **Contextualize**: If changes are staged, generate a commit message following Conventional Commits (type: subject).
3. **Execute**:
    - If the user said "commit", run `git commit -m "Generated Message"`.
    - If the user said "push", run `git push`.
    - If the user said "status", just show the status.
4. **Safety**: Always ask for confirmation before pushing to execution (unless user used -y flag).
