## [Ω] THE BASELINE DECREE: Operational Snapshot
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-06 18:54 EST
**Active Persona**: ODIN
**Audit Scope**: Sovereign Engine Core (Baseline)
**Subject Status**: SYSTEM STABLE / QUALITY RECOVERING
**Annexation Status**: EMPIRE TDD ESTABLISHED (Legacy Tests Quarantined)

## 🏗️ 1. Structural Integrity (The Sentinel's Vigil)
**Linscott Standard Compliance Rating**: **72.1%**

### 🚩 Critical Breaches (STRUCT-001)
The following sectors exhibit "Orphaned Logic" (Logic not encapsulated in Classes or privatized). This is a Class-A violation of the Linscott Standard.
- **`.agent/scripts/`**: 39 Anomalies detected.
  - `audit_dialogue.py`: `run_audit` is orphaned.
  - `benchmark_engine.py`: `benchmark` is orphaned.
  - `code_sentinel.py`: `run_ruff`/`format_results` are orphaned.
  - `cstar_dispatcher.py`: `help_command` is orphaned.
  - `debt_viz.py`: Entire scan logic is orphaned.
  - `latency_check.py`: `measure_startup` is orphaned.

### ⚠️ Linting & Typing (Ruff/ANN)
- **`sv_engine.py`**: 58 Breaches (Missing type annotations, `os.path` usage instead of `Pathlib`).
- **`fishtest.py`**: 74 Breaches (Unsorted imports, missing return types, line length violations).
- **`cstar_dispatcher.py`**: 26 Breaches (Unused `json` import, missing return types).

## 🧠 2. Neural Performance (The Crucible)
**Verdict**: **FAIL (Regression)**
**Accuracy**: 94.7%
**Latency**: 0.39ms / target

### Analysis
While 94.7% is mathematically high, it fails the "Zero Regression" mandate. Specific failures in intent mapping:
- "I want to make the dashboard" -> Expected `/run-task`, Got `skill-scout`.
- "visuals clean" -> Expected `SovereignFish`, Got `GLOBAL:ui-sci-fi`.
- "can you investigate the latency?" -> Expected `/investigate`, Got `GLOBAL:perf-profiler`.

## 🛡️ 3. Security Perimeter (Heimdall's Gate)
**System Threat Score**: **Low (1.5/10)**

- **`.agent/scripts/sv_engine.py`**: 0/10 (Secure).
- **`.agent/scripts/cstar_dispatcher.py`**: 0/10 (Secure).
- **`.agent/scripts/synapse_sync.py`**: 5/10 (Flagged: External Network/Socket imports. *Status: Authorized for Sync*).

---

## 🎨 4. HUD Aesthetic Audit
**Verdict**: **MODERATE INCONSISTENCY**

- **`cstar_dispatcher.py`**: **VIOLATION**. Uses raw `print()` and emojis instead of the `HUD` primitives defined in `ui.py`.
- **`ui.py`**: **INTEGRATED**. Provides robust Glow/Odin theme support, but many scripts only use basic `HUD.log` rather than full `box_top`/`box_row` layout patterns.
- **Alignment**: Box-drawing characters are correctly handled via UTF-8 enforcement in `ui.py`.

---

## 📉 5. Structural Debt (Combat Analysis)
**Average Complexity**: 4.1 (Rank A)

### ☢️ War Zones (Top Complexity)
1. **`set_persona.py`**: Rank D (28) - Logic block in `main` is monolithic and needs refactoring.
2. **`synapse_sync.py`**: Rank D (30) - `main` entry point is overly complex.
3. **`install_skill.py`**: Rank C (19) - Error handling loop is deeply nested.
4. **`sv_engine.py`**: Rank C (17) - `search` function is becoming a "God Function".

---

## 📄 6. Documentation & QMD Sovereignty
- **Migration Status**: **INCOMPLETE**.
  - `odin_protocol/README.md` still exists as `.md`.
  - Core workflows (`plan.md`, `execute.md`, etc.) are kept as `.md` for "Hybrid Menu Discovery" (Approved), but internal links in `wireframe.qmd` are healthy.
- **Link Integrity**: 100% of paths in `wireframe.qmd` resolved successfully to the filesystem.
