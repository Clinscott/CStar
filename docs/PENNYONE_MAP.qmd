# ◤ THE COMPASS OF ASGARD ◢

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MANDATE**: All agents MUST consult this map before performing deep file reads or wide searches in the source code.

## ◈ Purpose
The PennyOne system converts raw code into high-fidelity intelligence. Instead of reading thousands of lines of raw code, agents should query the `.stats/` directory first to identify targets by **Intent**, **Complexity**, and **Gravity**.

## ◈ The Hall of Records (`.stats/`)
Every file in the repository has a corresponding `.qmd` report in the `.stats/` directory. These reports are named using a flattened path:
- Source: `src/core/sv_engine.py`
- Report: `.stats/src-core-sv_engine-py.qmd`

## ◈ Searching the Matrix
Agents should use the following tools to find their path:

### 1. Unified Search (Cross-Platform)
Run `cstar p1 --search <query>` to perform a platform-aware search through the intent summaries and metadata. This replaces raw `grep` and ensures consistent results on Windows, Linux, and Unix.

### 2. Identifying Hotspots
Consult `cstar p1 --stats` to find "High Gravity" files where agents frequently interact or get stuck in logic loops.

### 3. API Discovery
Look for files tagged with `## API Endpoints` in their reports. These are the gateways of the system.

## ◈ Metadata Definitions
- **Logic [L]**: Structural branching density. Lower is more linear; higher is more complex.
- **Style [S]**: Aesthetic symmetry and naming purity.
- **Intel [I]**: Documentation density and transparency.
- **Gravity [G]**: Real-time agent interaction frequency. High gravity indicates a "Sector of Interest."
