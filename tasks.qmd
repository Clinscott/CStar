# Task: Corvus Star Framework Development

## ⚡ Sovereign Commands (Workflows)
All commands call specific logic in `.agent/workflows/` (Hybrid Extension: `.md` for Menu discovery).
- `/lets-go` → [lets-go.md](.agent/workflows/lets-go.md): Resume state and identify priorities.
- `/run-task` → [run-task.md](.agent/workflows/run-task.md): Targeted execution of user requests.
- `/investigate` → [investigate.md](.agent/workflows/investigate.md): Deep code exploration and debugging.
- `/plan` → [plan.md](.agent/workflows/plan.md): Blueprinting and architecture.
- `/test` → [test.md](.agent/workflows/test.md): Integrity, regression, and performance validation.
- `/wrap-it-up` → [wrap-it-up.md](.agent/workflows/wrap-it-up.md): Session cleanup and handshake.
- `/sovereignfish` → [SovereignFish.qmd](.agent/workflows/SovereignFish.qmd): Self-improvement protocol.

## 🗺️ Core Components
- **The Sovereign Engine** (`.agent/scripts/engine/`):
    - `vector.py`: High-performance intent resolution (LRU Cache, Unicode, Stemming).
    - `dialogue.py`: Persona-aware response retrieval and scoring.
    - `cortex.py`: RAG-powered documentation ingestion and querying.
- **The Knowledge Core** (`skills_db/`): Decentralized skill registry.
- **The Workforce** (`skills/` and `.agent/skills/`): Project-specific automation logic.

### 2. Annexation Execution
- [ ] **Execution Module**: Implement `--execute` in `annex.py` to auto-remediate breaches identified by Heimdall.
- [ ] **Rollback Safety**: Finalize the reversal protocol for failed annexation attempts during auto-remediation.

### 3. Coverage Saturation
