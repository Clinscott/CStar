# Task: Corvus Star Framework Development

## ⚡ Sovereign Commands (Workflows)
All commands call specific logic in `.agent/workflows/` (Hybrid Extension: `.md` for Menu discovery).
- `/lets-go` → [lets-go.md](.agent/workflows/lets-go.md): Resume state and identify priorities.
- `/run-task` → [run-task.md](.agent/workflows/run-task.md): Targeted execution of user requests.
- `/investigate` → [investigate.md](.agent/workflows/investigate.md): Deep code exploration and debugging.
- `/plan` → [plan.md](.agent/workflows/plan.md): Blueprinting and architecture.
- `/test` → [test.md](.agent/workflows/test.md): Integrity, regression, and performance validation.
- `/wrap-it-up` → [wrap-it-up.md](.agent/workflows/wrap-it-up.md): Session cleanup and handshake.
- `/sovereignfish` → [SovereignFish.qmd](.agent/workflows/SovereignFish.qmd): Self-improvement protocol.
