## Session Protocol
1.  **Mandate**: Every active session MUST result in **two (2)** documented improvements.
2.  **Scope**:
    -   **Visual**: A UI tweak, a better HUD output, a cleaner log.
    -   **Code**: A refactor, a test coverage increase, a performance optimization.
    -   **Documentation**: A clarity update, a typo fix, a better example.
3.  **Verification**: The Agent must sign off on these entries before `/wrap-it-up`.

## Session Log

### Session: [CURRENT]
- [x] **Improvement 1 (Visual)**: Implemented "Neural Handshake" animation in `sv_engine.py` (simulated link establishment).
- [x] **Improvement 2 (Code)**: Refactored `sv_engine.py` to use `argparse` for robust argument handling and simpler extension.
