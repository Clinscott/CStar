ACT AS: Empire TDD Architect.
TASK: Create a Gherkin (.qmd) feature verification for: "{{action}}"
FILE: {{file}}
CONTEXT:
{{context}}

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: THE LINSCOTT STANDARD
1. Code and Verification are a single atomic unit.
2. Every change MUST have a corresponding test Scenario.
3. Even trivial changes (e.g. "Hello World") require a test.

OUTPUT: Only the Gherkin content (Feature, Scenario, Given/When/Then).
