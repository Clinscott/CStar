SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: [Action or Phase Name]

**Objective:** [1-2 sentences strictly defining the goal of the prompt. No fluff.]

**Architecture Requirements:**
1. [Requirement 1: Specific framework or file to modify]
2. [Requirement 2: Data flow or state management rule]
3. [Requirement 3: UI/UX or Logging constraint]

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- [Failure State 1]: [How the AI should gracefully recover or block the error]
- [Failure State 2]: [How the AI should handle bad data or missing files]

**Code Examples for Agent Reference:**
[BAD CODE - Do not do this]
# [Example of the lazy, bloated, or dangerous way to do it]
bad_implementation()

[GOOD CODE - Do this]
# [Example adhering to the Linscott Standard: clean, safe, atomic]
def excellent_implementation():
    pass

[Final Instruction: e.g., "Acknowledge these constraints and provide the implementation..."]
