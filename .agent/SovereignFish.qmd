## Session Protocol
1.  **Mandate**: Every active session MUST result in **two (2)** documented improvements.
2.  **Scope**:
    -   **Visual**: A UI tweak, a better HUD output, a cleaner log.
    -   **Code**: A refactor, a test coverage increase, a performance optimization.
    -   **Documentation**: A clarity update, a typo fix, a better example.
3.  **Verification**: The Agent must sign off on these entries before `/wrap-it-up`.

## Session Log

### Session: [Hardening Ragnarok (Session 66)]
- [x] **Improvement 1 (Arch)**: Implemented Dynamic Model Discovery in `antigravity_bridge.py` to optimize persona-based routing for ALFRED and ODIN.
- [x] **Improvement 2 (Resilience)**: Injected Asynchronous Exponential Backoff in the bridge to handle transient API quota/availability errors (Ghost Protocol).

### Session: [Wrap-It-Up Execution]
- [x] **Improvement 1 (Doc)**: Updated `README.qmd` with Refined Persona (Odin/Alfred) lore-alignment details.
- [x] **Improvement 2 (Code)**: Added `__repr__` method to `DialogueRetriever` in `engine/dialogue.py` for improved debuggability.

### Session: [CURRENT]
- [x] **Improvement 1 (Visual)**: Implemented "Neural Handshake" animation in `sv_engine.py` (simulated link establishment).
- [x] **Improvement 2 (Code)**: Refactored `sv_engine.py` to use `argparse` for robust argument handling and simpler extension.

### Session: [PLAN_INIT]
- [x] **Improvement 1 (Doc/Arch)**: Extended "Subconscious Architecture" (Whisper/Void) to `AGENTS.qmd` and `investigate.qmd` ensuring consistent persona duality.
- [x] **Improvement 2 (Visual)**: Standardized header formatting for `run-task.qmd` to match the new `plan.qmd` style.
