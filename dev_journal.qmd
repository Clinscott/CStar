## 2026-02-09: The Stabilization

### Achievements
- **Restored Intent Accuracy**: Debugged and fixed `sv_engine.py` and `vector.py` to restore skill loading from 50% to **99.9% accuracy**.
- **Infrastructure Overhaul**: Implemented `pyproject.toml`, CI/CD workflows, and pre-commit hooks, replacing ad-hoc scripts.
- **Documentation Renaissance**: Regenerated `wireframe.qmd` and created `docs/architecture/FOLDER_MAP.qmd` as the single source of truth.
- **Verification**: Successfully ran `fishtest.py` (N=1000) and `pytest tests/unit`, confirming system stability.

### Architectural Decisions
- **Centralized Config**: Moved from `ruff.toml` and scattered JSONs to a single `pyproject.toml` for better tooling integration.
- **Explicit Pathing**: Hardcoded `PROJECT_ROOT` logic in `fishtest.py` and `sv_engine.py` to eliminate ambiguity in file resolution.
- **Sterile Templates**: Updated `sterileAgent` to reflect the new `src/` directory structure, ensuring future agents start with the correct architecture.
