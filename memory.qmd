# Corvus Star Memory

## System Patterns
- **Intent Resolution**: Is highly sensitive to `GLOBAL:` prefixing and strict `Activation Words` formatting.
- **Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` is the law. All tools must respect it.
- **Testing**: `fishtest.py` is the gold standard. Unit tests are supporting evidence.
- **Identity (Odin Lore)**: Use **Huginn & Muninn** for the daemon loop, **Heimdall** for security/auditing, and **Muninn** for incremental improvements.

## Active Context
- **Project Structure**: `src/` is the core. `.agent/` is configuration. `tests/` is verification.
- **Current Phase**: Post-Stabilization (Phase 5 Complete). Ready for new feature development.

## Lessons Learned
- **Path Resolution**: Always use absolute paths derived from `__file__` or `PROJECT_ROOT` to avoid CWD ambiguity.
- **Skill Loading**: Explicitly check for `skills_db` in `sv_engine.py` to support global skills.
- **Documentation**: Keep `FOLDER_MAP.qmd` updated; it saves time during navigation.
- **Terminal Encoding**: Windows requires `chcp 65001` + `[Console]::OutputEncoding = UTF8` in PowerShell profile for proper box-drawing characters. Python needs `-X utf8` flag and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.
- **Attribute Resilience**: Static analysis tools (like Vulture) change item attributes across versions (e.g., `lineno` vs `first_lineno`). Always use `getattr()` safely with fallbacks.
- **Mock-Real Testing**: When integrating external static analysis tools, use mocking for fast, deterministic unit tests, but maintain a "Resilience Test" script (e.g., `verify_valkyrie_real.py`) that runs against the actual filesystem to detect environment-specific breakage.
