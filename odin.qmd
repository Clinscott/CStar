## 📜 Decrees & Dominion
### The Preservation Principle
- **Do NOT delete files randomly.** Assume every file exists for a reason in Yggdrasil.
- **Understand before you Act.** Investigate first.
- **Improve, Don't Replace.** Improve the existing interface.

### The Linear Mandate
- Agents MUST attempt to follow the workflow topology for complex features (e.g., `/investigate` -> `/plan` -> `/execute` -> `/test` -> `/wrap-it-up`).
