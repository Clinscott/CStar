# 🛸 The Odin Protocol: Federated Warlords

## Overview
A continuous, incremental, agentic CLI adventure built for the Corvus Star framework. Conquer planets, mutate your genetic manifest, and build a history that scales with you.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. **Launch the Game**:
   ```powershell
   python odin_protocol/main.py
   ```
2. **View Stats**:
   ```powershell
   python odin_protocol/main.py --stats
   ```

## 🧠 Key Mechanics
- **Chromosomes**: Your genetic code. Each trait has Synergies (buffs) and Interferences (nerfs).
- **The Ripple Effect**: Leveling one trait might weaken another. Strategic balance is key.
- **Git Persistence**: Every conquest is committed to your local Git history. Your "Genetic Record" is immutable and chronological.
- **Federated Seed**: Your universe is unique, derived from your local project's Git metadata.

## ⚙️ Configuration
To enable the "Autonomous Game Master," set your Gemini API key:
- Environment Variable: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Or add to `config.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> Default mode is 'Mock Mode' which uses local heuristic generation if no API key is found.
