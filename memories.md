  items:
    - Corvus Star (C*): Formerly AgLng. Plain-English-to-Workflow mapping using SovereignVector.
    - Aesthetic Standard: CLI tools must use the `HUD` class for Box-Drawing/Color/Progress output. "Text is User Interface."
    - Smart-Merge 2.0: Installation script supports section-aware merging and automatic backups.
    - SovereignVector: Local Python engine for intent recognition; supports tiered proactive recommendations (>90% triggers JIT install).
    - Intelligent Handshake: Non-destructive installation script (`install.ps1`) with interactive conflict resolution (O/S/M/D).
    - Global Registry: Centralized `skills_db/` in `CorvusStar` for cross-project capability sharing.
    - Encoding Rule: Use BOM-less UTF-8 for all Inter-agent configs (JSON/MD) to avoid PowerShell/Python encoding conflicts.
    - Interaction Pattern: High-confidence (>90%) local intent matches should trigger an interactive confirmation (Y/n) rather than just a proposal.
    - Lightning Protocol: File optimization skills should follow a Read -> HUD -> Modify -> Report loop (as seen in `lightning_rod.py`).
    - SovereignFish Mandate: Use the `SovereignFish` protocol EVERY session to implement 2 minor improvements (visual/code) that are NOT in the prompt.
