# Investigate Workflow

Follow these steps to perform a deep analytical dive into a specific aspect of the application.

## 1. Define and Locate
1. **Identify the Target**: Explicitly state what function, component, or feature is being investigated.
2. **Check Context**: Read `memory.qmd` to understand established patterns or known issues related to the target.
3. **Consult Wireframe**: Check `wireframe.qmd` to match UI components with their documented functions and paths.
13. **Locate Resources**: Consult the "Project Directory Structure" in `wireframe.qmd` and find all related files.
   - Core logic (services, lib)
   - UI components
   - API routes
   - Tests
   - Types

## 2. Deep Code Analysis
Read the files and analyze for:
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to patterns, DRY principles, and readability.
- **Functionality**: strict verification that the code performs its intended purpose.
- **Missing Counterparts**: Look for logical gaps (e.g., Login exists but Logout is missing; Create exists but Delete is missing).
- **Security & Safety**: proper validation, error handling, and authorization checking.
- **Layout Integration**: Does this component/page respect the global **DashboardLayout**? Is it trying to break out of the HUD? (This is strictly forbidden for core feature pages).

## 3. System Interaction Check
- **Dependencies**: How does this interact with the rest of the app?
- **Side Effects**: Does it modify global state or DB in unexpected ways?
- **Usage**: Where is it used? Are the consumers using it correctly?

## 4. Improvement Scans
- **Optimization**: Can it be faster or lighter?
- **UX/DX**: Can the user experience or developer experience be improved?
- **Refactoring**: Are there larger structural improvements needed?

## 5. Report Findings
Produce a summary of the investigation:
- **Status**: (Healthy / Needs Attention / Critical)
- **Findings**: Bulleted list of issues or observations.
- **Recommendations**: Concrete steps to improve the code/feature.
