# Developer Journal Instructions

The `DEV_JOURNAL.md` file records the chronological evolution of the project, focusing on architectural decisions, breakthroughs, and persistent challenges.

## Goal
Preserve the "why" behind technical decisions and provide a narrative history of the project's development.

## Maintenance Rules
1. **Daily/Session Entries**: Create a new entry for every session where significant progress or decisions are made.
2. **High-Level Summary**: Start with a summary of what was accomplished.
3. **Architectural Decisions**: Document why a specific pattern, library, or structure was chosen.
4. **Breakthroughs & Fixes**: Record solved bugs that were particularly complex or non-obvious.
5. **Current State**: Briefly describe the state of the project at the end of the session.

## Template
