# 🐟 Corvus Star Framework: Agent Language & Skill Ecosystem

Corvus Star (C*) is a high-performance, local intelligence framework designed to map natural language intent to specialized agent workflows. It enables seamless "Plain-English-to-Workflow" interaction for AI agents, specifically optimized for the Antigravity/Gemini API.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

To deploy the Corvus Star protocols into a new project, run the following command **from this project's root**:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -TargetDir "C:\path\to\your\new\project"
```

**What it does:**
- Initializes the `.agent/` structure with workflows, skills, and the SovereignVector engine.
- Deploys `synapse_sync.py` for Mimir's Eye connectivity.
- **Automatically installs** Python dependencies (`ruff`, `radon`) if Python is detected.
- Creates an installation log at `.agent/install.log` for troubleshooting.
- Stamps version metadata (install date, Git hash) into `config.json`.

## 🔒 Security & Performance
- **Dynamic Portability**: Resolves source paths via `$PSScriptRoot` for flexible deployment.
- **Automated Dependency Injection**: Auto-installs `ruff` and `radon` via `pip`.
- **Knowledge Audit Trail**: Comprehensive installation logging in `.agent/install.log`.
- **Hardened Authentication**: `synapse_sync.py --push` requires verified Git permissions.
- **Shielded Operations**: Comprehensive path traversal and shell injection protection.
- **Lore-Accurate Versioning**: Stamped installation metadata in `config.json`.

**Note:** The installer is now **fully portable** - you can clone this repo anywhere and run the script from its location.

## 🏗️ Core Components

### 1. SovereignVector Engine (`.agent/scripts/sv_engine.py`)
A standalone Python engine that handles intent recognition locally. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to match your requests to the most relevant "Skill" or "Workflow."

- **No APIs Required**: Works entirely offline.
- **Context-Aware**: Ingests your `thesaurus.qmd` and active project context to improve accuracy.
- **Mimir's Eye (Synapse)**: Distributed knowledge core allowing bidirectional synchronization of Skills and Corrections.
- **Iron Cortex**: RAG-based intelligence for querying project documentation.

### 2. The Trace & Learning Loop
The system is designed to be transparent. Every action starts with an **Interpretation Trace**:
1. **Trace Output**: The agent explains *what* it heard and *why* it chose a specific skill.
2. **User Correction**: If the mapping is wrong, simply say: *"No, I meant [Skill Name]"*.
3. **Learning**: The system automatically saves this correction to `.agent/corrections.json`, ensuring it never makes the same mistake again.

### 3. Skills Repository (`.agent/skills/`)
A collection of specialized agent abilities:
- **GitAuto**: Managed commits and branch safety.
- **EnvDoctor**: System health and dependency audits.
- **KnowledgeHunter**: Deep-dive research across local files and the web.

### 4. Refined Personas (The Great Duality)
The framework operates under two lore-accurate personas:
- **ODIN (The All-Father)**: Cryptic, observational, and riddling. Guided by the *Hávamál*.
- **ALFRED (The Butler)**: Firm, gentle, and witty. Guided by the *Pennyworth Protocol*.
- **System Naming**: Mirroring names like *Mimir's Well* vs *The Brain* ensure thematic consistency.

### 5. The Neural Overwatch & Federation
- **Neural Overwatch**: Real-time terminal dashboard (`overwatch.py`) for monitoring federated agent activity.
- **The Crucible**: Automated "Trial by Combat" ingestion system that verifies external traces before merging.
- **Law of Latency**: Strict performance monitoring ensures the engine never regresses >5ms.

## 🏆 The Linscott Standard
This framework is built on the **Linscott Standard** of software excellence:
- **Trust, but Verify**: Every interpretation is traced for your review.
- **Empire TDD Standard**: All new logic must be verified via `.qmd` contracts. Legacy tests are quarantined.
- **Statistical Proof**: Features must be verified via the **Fishtest Protocol**.
- **No Regressions**: High-performance local checks ensure system stability.
