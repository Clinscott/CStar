Feature: Sovereign Matrix Aesthetic Overhaul
  Lore: "Verifying the visual fidelity of the Manor's logic."
  Standard: Linscott Standard (Atomic Verification)

  Scenario: Cinematic rendering initialization
    Given the Sovereign Matrix data is successfully fetched
    And the WebGL context is established
    When the visualization mounts
    Then the scene should contain core node geometries
    And the Bloom post-processing effect should be active

  Scenario: Animated data pulse propagation
    Given neural pathways are established between nodes
    When the render loop executes
    Then the lines should exhibit a dash-offset animation
    And the pulse colors should match the persona aura

  Scenario: Holographic iconography display
    Given specific nodes are identified as agents or tools
    When the matrix is viewed
    Then holographic sprites should render at node positions
    And appropriate pixel-art assets should be loaded
