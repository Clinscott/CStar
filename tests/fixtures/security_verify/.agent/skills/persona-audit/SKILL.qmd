# Persona Audit Skill

Utilize this skill to verify that the agent's recent communication adheres to the mandated persona.

## Activation Words:
audit, identity, purity, check voice, persona alignment

## Usage:
1. **Audit String**: `python .agent/scripts/audit_dialogue.py "Your text here"`
2. **Audit File**: `python .agent/scripts/audit_dialogue.py --file path/to/report.qmd`

## Logic:
The skill calculate the token overlap between the input and the persona's designated `dialogue_db` corpus.

- **ODIN**: Expects powerful, archaic, and clinical terminology.
- **ALFRED**: Expects polite, servile, and manor-context terminology.

## Workflow Integration:
Run this as the final step of any major report generation to ensure compliance with the Linscott Standard's Persona Fidelity mandate.
