Feature: SC-001 Catalog Readiness Check Execution
  As an Empire TDD Architect
  I want to scaffold a test for catalog_check.py
  So that I can verify the SovereignVector engine initializes and executes a basic search query successfully.

  Scenario: Successful Initialization and Search Validation
    Given the core SovereignVector dependencies are available
      And the required input files (thesaurus.qmd, corrections.json, stopwords.json) are present
      And the 'catalog_check.py' script is accessible
    When the 'catalog_check.py' script is executed using the Python interpreter
    Then the execution must exit successfully with an exit code of 0
      And the standard output must contain the diagnostic "Tokens:"
      And the standard output must contain the structure "Trigger Map for 'start':"
      And the standard output must contain the final search result indicator "Top Result:" or "No results found."
