Feature: Core Search Engine Initialization and Index Verification (catalog_check.py)

  Background: Engine Setup Prerequisites
    Given SovereignVector dependencies (thesaurus.qmd, corrections.json, stopwords.json) are present
    And the necessary initialization scripts exist

  Scenario: Successful Index Building and Retrieval of a Basic Query
    Given the SovereignVector engine has initialized, loaded core skills, and built its index
    When the script `catalog_check.py` is executed
    Then the output buffer should contain the tokens: "['catalog', 'start']"
      And the "Trigger Map for 'start'" should display a non-empty result
      And a positive search result should be found (r is not None)
      And the message "Top Result:" is printed to stdout
      And the script exits successfully (exit code 0)

  Scenario: Handling of the No Results Path (Implicit Check)
    Given the SovereignVector engine is initialized
    When a known non-indexed query is hypothetically searched
    Then the conditional logic ensures that if no results are found, the message "No results found." is printed
      # Note: This scenario verifies the path coverage of the existing `if r:` block.
