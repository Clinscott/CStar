Feature: Muninn Module Naming Consistency

  Scenario: Instantiating the Muninn agent via the run function
    Given the Muninn class is defined in src/sentinel/muninn.py
    When the run function is called
    Then it should instantiate the Muninn class correctly
    And it should not fail with a NameError for SovereignFish
