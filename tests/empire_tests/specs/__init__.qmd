Feature: Verify __init__.py scaffolding

  As a developer, I want to ensure that the `__init__.py` file is properly scaffolded
  so that Python recognizes the directory as a package.

  Scenario: Ensure __init__.py exists and is importable

    Given the file "src/__init__.py" exists
    When I import the "src" package
    Then the import should succeed
