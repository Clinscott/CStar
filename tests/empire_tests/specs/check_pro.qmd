Feature: Check Pro Model Availability

  This feature verifies that the script `check_pro.py` successfully checks the availability of Gemini Pro models via the `google.genai` library.  It specifically ensures that the script attempts to generate content using a list of candidate models and reports success or failure for each.

  Scenario: Script executes successfully and checks model availability
    Given the script "check_pro.py" exists and has a valid Google API key configured
    When the script "check_pro.py" is executed
    Then the script initializes the google.genai client
    And the script attempts to generate content with each model in the candidate list
    And for each model, the script prints either "SUCCESS" or "FAILED" along with any exception message
