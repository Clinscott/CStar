Feature: Documentation Syntax Conversion (Edda)

  Scenario Outline: Convert legacy blockquotes to Quarto alerts
    Given a markdown blockquote with content <legacy>
    When the Edda Weaver transmutes the file
    Then the resulting .qmd should contain the Quarto alert <quarto>

    Examples:
      | legacy           | quarto               |
      | "> Note: This"  | "> [!NOTE] This"     |
      | "> Warning: Careful" | "> [!WARNING] Careful" |
      | "> Important: Key" | "> [!IMPORTANT] Key" |
      | "> Just text"    | "> [!NOTE] Just text" |
