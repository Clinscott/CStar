Feature: CJK Check

  Scenario: Successful CJK Query and Result Display
    Given the SovereignVector is initialized with 'thesaurus.qmd', '.agent/corrections.json', and '.agent/scripts/stopwords.json'
    And the SovereignVector has loaded core skills and built the index
    When I search for the CJK term "部署"
    Then the search should return results
    And the output should display the query "部署"
    And the output should display the score of the top result
    And the output should display the trigger of the top result

  Scenario: No Results for CJK Query
    Given the SovereignVector is initialized with 'thesaurus.qmd', '.agent/corrections.json', and '.agent/scripts/stopwords.json'
    And the SovereignVector has loaded core skills and built the index
    When I search for a non-existent CJK term "不存在的词语"
    Then the search should return no results
    And the output should display "Query: 不存在的词语 -> No results"
