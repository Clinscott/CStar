Feature: SovereignHUD UI Integrity

  Scenario: Box Rendering
    Given the SovereignHUD class is initialized
    When SovereignHUD.box_top("Test Title") is called
    And SovereignHUD.box_row("Label", "Value") is called
    And SovereignHUD.box_bottom() is called
    Then it should render a complete ANSI-colored box
    And no "duplicate method" warnings should be present in the source
