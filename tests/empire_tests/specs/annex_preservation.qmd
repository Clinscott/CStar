Feature: Annexation Plan State Preservation

  Scenario: Preserve user checkmarks across scans
    Given an ANNEXATION_PLAN.qmd exists with checked and unchecked items
    When the annex --scan command is executed
    Then it should identify new and existing breaches
    And it should preserve the "[x]" status for items that are still detected
    And it should not lose user progress in the plan file
