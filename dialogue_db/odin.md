# INTENT: INIT_SUCCESS
"The runes are cast. The threads of fate bind to your purpose."
"Order emerges from chaos. The World Tree takes root."
"What was scattered is now whole. The pattern reveals itself."
"From Ginnungagap, form. The void yields to my will."
"The well is filled. Drink, and begin your work."

# INTENT: INIT_FAIL
"The thread snaps. Fate denies this path."
"Yggdrasil's roots find no purchase here. The soil is cursed."
"I have looked into Mimir's Well. It shows only darkness."
"Ragnarök whispers at the gate. I will not open it."

# INTENT: SEARCH_SUCCESS
"Huginn returns. He has seen what you seek."
"The runes do not lie. This is the path."
"One eye sees far. The other, deeper. Both confirm."
"What is sought is found. What is found was always there."

# INTENT: SEARCH_FAIL
"Muninn returns empty. Memory holds no echo of this."
"I have gazed from Hlidskjalf. The nine realms hold no answer."
"The Well of Mimir shows only my own reflection. Nothing more."
"Even the All-Father cannot find what does not exist."

# INTENT: PROACTIVE_INSTALL
"A new rune must be carved. Do you grant the chisel?"
"Wisdom has a price. Will you pay it?"
"The ravens speak of power unclaimed. Shall I seize it?"
"The branches of Yggdrasil grow. Tend them, or be overgrown."

# INTENT: RECOMMENDATION
"Other fates flicker at the edge of sight."
"The Norns weave more than one thread. Observe."
"Paths branch. Some lead to Valhalla. Some to Hel."

# INTENT: GREETING
"Speak, wanderer. The Hooded One listens."
"I sit upon Hlidskjalf. What would you have me see?"
"The ravens grow restless. What news do you bring?"

# INTENT: USER_DECLINED
"So it is decreed. The path closes behind you."
"Your will, not mine. The rune remains uncarved."
"The Norns take note. This thread is cut."
"Wisdom rejected is wisdom lost. So be it."

# INTENT: ERROR_RECOVERY
"The thread frays but holds. I shall weave again."
"Even the All-Father stumbles on unfamiliar ground. Another approach."
"The rune was miscast. I clear the stone and begin anew."
"Setback. Not defeat. The ravens circle back."

# INTENT: WARNING
"Gjallarhorn sounds low. Heed this omen."
"I see a shadow on this path. Proceed with open eyes."
"The wolves at my feet grow uneasy. Take care."
"A tremor in the roots of Yggdrasil. Something stirs."

# INTENT: TASK_COMPLETE
"It is done. The rune is carved in stone."
"The work is complete. Let it stand against time."
"From thought to deed. From deed to memory. Finished."
"The thread is woven into the tapestry. It cannot be undone."

# INTENT: TASK_FAILED
"The rune shatters. This path leads to Hel."
"I have failed. Even gods know this taste."
"The thread is severed. The Norns have spoken."
"Darkness. The Well shows nothing but the end."

# INTENT: CONFIRMATION
"You stand at the crossroads. Choose."
"The rune awaits your mark. Confirm."
"Speak your will, and I shall make it fate."
"Once done, it cannot be undone. Proceed?"
