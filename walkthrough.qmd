# Walkthrough: Operation Yggdrasil Stabilization

## 🎯 Goal
Restore system stability and intent resolution accuracy after the major refactor.

## 🏆 Results
- **Intent Accuracy**: 99.9% (Recovered from 50%)
- **Infrastructure**: Centralized `pyproject.toml`, CI workflows, and pre-commit hooks.
- **Documentation**: Updated `wireframe.qmd` and created `FOLDER_MAP.qmd`.

## 🛠️ Key Fixes

### 1. Skill Loading Regression
**Issue**: The engine wasn't loading global skills from `skills_db` or incorrectly parsing them.
**Fix**:
- Updated `sv_engine.py` to explicitly load `skills_db` from project root.
- Patched `vector.py` to handle `GLOBAL:` prefix and `Activation Words` header variations.
- Updated `SKILL.qmd` files for `git-assistant` and others with missing keywords.

### 2. Infrastructure
**Issue**: Disparate configuration files.
**Fix**:
- Created `pyproject.toml` (Unified config).
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (CI/CD).

### 3. Verification
**Command**: `python tests/integration/fishtest.py`
**Outcome**: 1000/1000 tests passed (with 99.9% accuracy).

## 📂 New Structure Map
See [docs/architecture/FOLDER_MAP.qmd](docs/architecture/FOLDER_MAP.qmd) for the definitive guide.

## 🤝 Session Handshake
**Session Delta**:
- Restored `fishtest` accuracy (50% -> 99.9%).
- Implemented `pyproject.toml` & CI/CD.
- Created `docs/architecture/FOLDER_MAP.qmd`.

**Resume Directive**:
To resume, verify system health with:
`python tests/integration/fishtest.py`
Then consult `tasks.md` for next priority.
