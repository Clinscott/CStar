  items:
    - Corvus Star (C*): Formerly AgLng. Plain-English-to-Workflow mapping using SovereignVector.
    - Aesthetic Standard: CLI tools must use the `HUD` class for Box-Drawing/Color/Progress output. "Text is User Interface."
    - Smart-Merge 2.0: Installation script supports section-aware merging and automatic backups.
    - SovereignVector: Local Python engine for intent recognition; supports tiered proactive recommendations (>90% triggers JIT install).
    - Intelligent Handshake: Non-destructive installation script (`install.ps1`) with interactive conflict resolution (O/S/M/D).
    - Global Registry: Centralized `c:/Users/Craig/Corvus/CorvusStar/skills_db/` in `CorvusStar` for cross-project capability sharing.
    - Encoding Rule: Use BOM-less UTF-8 for all Inter-agent configs (JSON/MD) to avoid PowerShell/Python encoding conflicts.
    - Interaction Pattern: High-confidence (>90%) local intent matches should trigger an interactive confirmation (Y/n) rather than just a proposal.
    - Lightning Protocol: File optimization skills should follow a Read -> HUD -> Modify -> Report loop (as seen in `lightning_rod.py`).
    - SovereignFish Mandate: Use `/sovereignfish` workflow (`c:/Users/Craig/Corvus/CorvusStar/.agent/workflows/sovereignfish.qmd`) EVERY session to implement 5 improvements. Log to `c:/Users/Craig/Corvus/CorvusStar/SOVEREIGNFISH_LEDGER.qmd`.
    - The 85% Bar: Execution-level triggers must meet an 85% confidence score. Core workflows should be hard-mapped in `corrections.json` for 110% (1.10) confidence.
    - Intent Polarity: Use Vector Search for *Discovery* (finding new skills) and Corrections for *Execution* (triggering established workflows).
    - Fishtest Protocol 2.0: Tests must verify `min_score`, `is_global`, and `expected_mode` to be considered passing.
    - Weighted Nuance: Use `word:weight` in `thesaurus.qmd` (e.g., `go:0.5`) to dampen broad synonyms and preserve engine precision.
    - SPRT Standard: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (LLR-based) is the project's statistical verification standard for engine-level improvements.
    - Stemming Rule: Automated stemming for `-ing`, `-ed`, `-es`, `-s` suffixes is applied with a 0.8 weight to prevent noise in small datasets.
    - Neural Tracing: `trace_viz.py` is the standard tool for inspecting engine logic. It uses the "Glow" HUD aesthetic.
    - Stopword Policy: Stopwords must be externalized to `c:/Users/Craig/Corvus/CorvusStar/stopwords.json` to keep engine logic clean and allow for easy language swapping.
    - Trace Archiving: `TRACE_REPORT.qmd` must only show the CURRENT session's traces. Processed traces are moved to `traces/archive/`.
    - Real User Wins: In conflict resolution (Federated Learning), actual user trace data always overrides synthetic or theoretical test cases.
    - Scalability Benchmark: The testing infrastructure is certified for N=1000 execution at <0.5ms per call.
    - Learning by Memorization: High-value failing traces should be added directly to `corrections.json` for immediate resolution.
    - Persona Pattern: Store personality/voice settings in `config.json` and use a centralized theme dictionary (like `_get_theme()`) to drive CLI aesthetics dynamically.
    - Operational Divergence: Use the Strategy Pattern (`Personas.py`) to map "Soul" to "Behavior". ODIN = Strict Enforcement; ALFRED = Adaptive Service.
    - Vector Dialogue: Store system responses in markdown corpora (`dialogue_db/`) to be retrieved by semantic intent, not hardcoded strings.
    - Metadata Tagging: Use flexible `tags` arrays in test/trace data to store origin metadata (like Persona) rather than rigid schema columns.
    - Distributed Conflict Resolution: Real Trace > Synthetic Test. In Real vs Real conflicts, Last Writer Wins.
    - Trace Archiving: To prevent infinite ingestion loops, processed trace files must be moved to a `processed/` subdirectory immediately after reading.
    - Principle of Symmetry: Every feature or UI element for one persona must have a thematic equivalent for the others.
    - Linscott Standard: Universal rule. Code and Verification are an atomic unit.
    - The Great Duality: ODIN (Enforcer) and ALFRED (Servant) are distinct operational states.
    - Mimir's Eye (Knowledge Core): All Corvus instances sync to a central Git repo (`CorvusKnowledge`). 
    - Synapse Protocol: Use `synapse_sync.py` to Inhale (Pull) global skills and Exhale (Push) new discoveries.
    - Zero-Copy Discovery: `sv_engine.py` indexes `CorvusKnowledge/skills` directly, bypassing local copy until verified.
    - Skill Forge: New capabilities can be synthesized via `skill_forge.py` using RAG context from `AGENTS.qmd` and `wireframe.qmd`. Staged in `drafts/` for review.
    - Knowledge Extraction: `synapse_sync.py` automatically scrapes high-confidence `phrase_mappings` from `corrections.json` for global contribution.

    - Torvalds Mandate: Code quality is non-negotiable. Strict typing and Google-style docstrings are required for all core utilities.
    - Backbone Verification: Shared libraries (like ui.py) must have their own independent test suites (test_ui.py).
    - Subconscious Architecture: Inactive personas contribute Observation/Reminders (Alfred) or Void Shouts (Odin) to session context.
    - Alfred Persona Refinement: Alfred is firm but gentle. His subconscious voices are Aliased as [Alfred's Reminder], [Alfred's Query], and [Alfred's Observation].
    - SovereignFish N=100: Successfully completed the initial 100-improvement milestone (Sessions 9-21) to achieve system sovereignty.
    - Code Sentinel: The framework uses **Ruff** for structural integrity. Integrated into `/investigate` workflow to detect orphans and code smells via `code_sentinel.py`.
    - No Bare Except: Per the Linscott Standard, all `except:` blocks must specify exceptions (e.g. `except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError)`) to prevent silent structural failures.
    - Structural Debt Analysis: `debt_viz.py` is the project's "X-Ray". Use it regularly to identify unmaintainable blocks (CC > 10) before they become defects.
    - Secure Subprocess Standard: All external calls MUST use argument lists and `sys.executable`. Usage of `shell=True` is a Class-A violation of the Manor Protocol.
    - Path Sovereignty: No script may operate on a file path without first resolving it via `os.path.realpath` and verifying its prefix.
    - Synapse Lockout: Pushes to Mimir's Eye are governed by a 10/hour rate limit to prevent knowledge poisoning.
    - Neural Handshake (ZKP): Knowledge Core pushes require a SHA-256 challenge-response verification based on the `NeuralSecret`. Raw secrets are never transmitted.
    - Unicode Tokenization: Use `\w+` in tokenizers to capture CJK, Cyrillic, and other non-Latin scripts, ensuring intent parity for international teams.
    - LRU Search Cache: Vector engine search results should be cached by query phrase to achieve O(1) retrieval for common natural language commands.
    - Dynamic HUD Width: Auto-sensing UI width should include a 40-120 column "Safety Bracket" to ensure ASCII art and progress bars remain readable across varied console environments.
    - Campaign Roadmap (N=1000): Large-scale architectural campaigns must be indexed in a master `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.qmd` with numbered targets (1-1000) for high-fidelity progress tracking.
    - Intent Sink Pattern: Use a dedicated 'noise' skill with worldly nouns (e.g., 'coffee', 'gift') to act as a mathematical sink for non-technical adversarial traps.
    - Sanitized Clustering: Thesaurus intent groups must be atomic and non-overlapping. Overlapping keywords cause vector ambiguity.
    - Trigger Boost Dampening: Direct keyword trigger boosts should be dampened (0.3-0.5) for common technical verbs to prevent keyword gravity from overriding vector proximity.
    - The Ripple Effect (Genetic Math): Use a deterministic map for stat interactions (Synergy/Interference). One-level depth is the safety standard to prevent infinite recursive loops in effective stat calculations.
    - Federated Seeding: Seeding game instances with project-level Git metadata (hashes) ensures unique, persistent "Universes" across different framework instances.
    - Briefing Cooldown Protocol: High-value guidance systems should implement turn-based or time-based cooldowns (e.g., 3 turns) to preserve narrative weight and strategic value.
    - Immutable Game History: Use Git to persist game states. Committing the `save_state.json` with a descriptive message acts as a permanent, versioned chronicle of a player's journey.
    - Version-Agnostic Signature Check: When verifying type hints in tests, use string-based signature inspection (`inspect.signature`) to accommodate Python 3.9+ `dict` vs `typing.Dict` variants in different runtime environments.
    - Graceful Terminal Shutdown: Wrap main CLI loops in `KeyboardInterrupt` guards. Treat Ctrl+C as a saved "Dormancy" state rather than an exit crash to preserve user progress.
    - Weighted Die Cast (Probabilistic Adjudication): Use the ratio of Warlord Rating vs. Strategy Threshold for tactical success. Clamped between 5% and 95% to ensure perpetual stakes.
    - Empire TDD: Domain-Specific TDD Protocol using `.qmd` contracts. Enforces GIVEN-WHEN-THEN tripartite logic and deterministic stabilization.
    - Symbolic Shorthand ([token]): Use shorthands (e.g., `[$]`) for complex state setup to enable "Visual Grepping" during verification.
    - Baseline Remediation: The framework is hardened to the Linscott Standard. 39 orphaned functions encapsulated, Rank D complexity eliminated (CC < 10), and intent mapping calibrated to 97.8% accuracy.
    - Structural Encapsulation Doctrine: Orphaned functions in audited system scripts are forbidden. All logic must reside within strictly-typed classes (e.g., `CorvusDispatcher`, `DebtAnalyzer`).
    - Standardized Unicode Bridge: Use `errors='replace'` and UTF-8 encoding for all framework-to-shell communications to prevent Windows null-byte/glyph processing crashes.
    - TacticalRNG Standard: All randomness must be encapsulated in `rng.py` (TacticalRNG) to ensure deterministic testability and easy upgrade paths.
    - Empire Annexation: No component is exempt from the Empire TDD Protocol. 100% Coverage is the baseline, not the goal.
