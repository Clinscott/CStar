# 🐟 Corvus Star Framework: Agent Language & Skill Ecosystem

Corvus Star (C*) is a high-performance, local intelligence framework designed to map natural language intent to specialized agent workflows. It enables seamless "Plain-English-to-Workflow" interaction for AI agents, specifically optimized for the Antigravity/Gemini API.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

To deploy the Corvus Star protocols into a new project, run the following command from this project's root:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -TargetDir "C:\path\to\your\new\project"
```

*This will initialize the `.agent/` structure, deploy the `SovereignVector` engine, and install all core workflows and context templates.*

## 🏗️ Core Components

### 1. SovereignVector Engine (`.agent/scripts/sv_engine.py`)
A standalone Python engine that handles intent recognition locally. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to match your requests to the most relevant "Skill" or "Workflow."

- **No APIs Required**: Works entirely offline.
- **Context-Aware**: Ingests your `thesaurus.md` and active project context to improve accuracy.

### 2. The Trace & Learning Loop
The system is designed to be transparent. Every action starts with an **Interpretation Trace**:
1. **Trace Output**: The agent explains *what* it heard and *why* it chose a specific skill.
2. **User Correction**: If the mapping is wrong, simply say: *"No, I meant [Skill Name]"*.
3. **Learning**: The system automatically saves this correction to `.agent/corrections.json`, ensuring it never makes the same mistake again.

### 3. Skills Repository (`.agent/skills/`)
A collection of specialized agent abilities:
- **GitAuto**: Managed commits and branch safety.
- **EnvDoctor**: System health and dependency audits.
- **KnowledgeHunter**: Deep-dive research across local files and the web.

### 4. The Neural Overwatch & Federation
- **Neural Overwatch**: Real-time terminal dashboard (`overwatch.py`) for monitoring federated agent activity.
- **The Crucible**: Automated "Trial by Combat" ingestion system that verifies external traces before merging.
- **Law of Latency**: Strict performance monitoring ensures the engine never regresses >5ms.

## 🏆 The Linscott Standard
This framework is built on the **Linscott Standard** of software excellence:
- **Trust, but Verify**: Every interpretation is traced for your review.
- **Statistical Proof**: Features must be verified via the **Fishtest Protocol**.
- **No Regressions**: High-performance local checks ensure system stability.
